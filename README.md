# FISH-Forth-V1.6
My Reference Model Forth for ARM M0-M4, specifically this is for the STM32 407vg Discovery Board
and Simons STP STM32 205rc board.

The Library folders and files locations are normally outside the port folder for support of Multiple chips.
This is a specific chip and version, a I may place the lib folders inside the port folder to allow a standalone clone.
