# FISH-Forth-V1.6
My Reference Model Forth for ARM M0-M4, specifically this is for the STM32F407vg Discovery Board,

The Library folders and files locations are normally outside the port folder for support of multiple boards and chips.
This is a specific chip and version, and I will place the lib folders inside the port folder to allow a standalone clone.
